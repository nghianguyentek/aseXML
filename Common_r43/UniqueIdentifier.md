# UniqueIdentifier Type

*String*

- MinLength: 1
- MaxLength: 36

## Purpose

Uniquely identify the associated data element or attribute.

## Detail

Note that unique identifiers do not have to be globally unique, only unique to a particular sender. However, the length has been chosen such that UUIDs can be used as identifiers if considered appropriate, guaranteeing global uniqueness.
