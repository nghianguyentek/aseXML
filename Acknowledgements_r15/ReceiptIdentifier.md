# ReceiptIdentifier Type

*Extends [UniqueIdentifier](../Common_r43/UniqueIdentifier.md)*

## Purpose

Provide a unique identifier to acknowledge a message or transaction.

## Detail

A receipt identifier is generated by the receiver of an aseXML message or transaction. Its purpose is to provide the sender with a string that can be quoted when inquiring with regard to the progress of processing for a message or transaction. As implied by the name, it is the sender's guarantee that the receiver will process the message or transaction.

Note that receipt identifiers do not have to be globally unique, only unique to a particular receiver. However, the length has been chosen such that UUIDs can be used as receipt identifiers if considered appropriate, guaranteeing global uniqueness.
